## Plan for case-study on fishery

Potential output:
1.	white paper/methods paper for opted
1.	Agenda-setting study fishery from cross-country perspective

#### 1.	Linkage on different levels

1.	**Topic**; ‘fishing’ present or not.
	-	Do we need some attributes as well? valence, evaluations...
2.	**Actors**: persons, organizations, political parties...
	-	labelled data
	-	Entity recognition
	-	Wiki-data
3.	**Similar scores** / word mover distance (word embeddings) (for later)

#### 2.	Data

1.	**country selection:**
	1.	Nederlands
	2.	Denmark?
	3.	UK?

2.	**time selection:**
	* timeframe ...

3.	**agenda selection**
	1.	*political agenda*:
	party manifestos from CMP
	…. from CAP (depending on timeframe/ country selection)
	2.	*traditional newspaper agenda*:  newspapers? INCA/ AMCAT
	3.	*social media*: twitter?

Note: with regards to the European Parliament data; we have to scrape this I guess (because of issues described [here](../info-on-datasets.md))

#### 3.	Requesting budget for ..

1.	annotating text units for persons/ organizations/ potentially also bills?
2.	annotating text units for the topic of fishery + potentially some evaluation/ attributes?

- how will we handle language differences?
-	can we use the VU-annotator tool?
